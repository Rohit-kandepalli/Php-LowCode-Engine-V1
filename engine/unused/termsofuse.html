						<h3>Payment</h3>
						<p>The Services may be free or we may charge a fee for using the Services. If you are using a free version of the Services, we will notify you before any Services you are then using begin carrying a fee, and if you wish to continue using such Services, you must pay all applicable fees for such Services. Note that if you elect to receive text messages through the Services, data and message rates may apply. Any and all such charges, fees or costs are your sole responsibility. You should consult with your wireless carrier to determine what rates, charges, fees or costs may apply to your use of the Services.</p>
						<ol>
							<li><strong>Paid Services.</strong> Certain of our Services , may be subject to payments now or in the future (the "Paid Services").  Please note that any payment terms presented to you in the process of using or signing up for a Paid Service are deemed part of these Terms.</li>
							<li><strong>Billing.</strong>We use a third-party payment processor (the "Payment Processor") to bill you through a payment account linked to your account on the Services (your "Billing Account") for use of the Paid Services. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to these Terms. We are not responsible for error by the Payment Processor. By choosing to use Paid Services, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of such Paid Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms and you authorize us, through the Payment Processor, to charge your chosen payment provider (your "Payment Method"). You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that the Payment Processor makes even if it has already requested or received payment.</li>
							<li><strong>Payment Method.</strong>The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method. If we, through the Payment Processor, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.</li>
							<li><strong>Recurring Billing.</strong>Some of the Paid Services may consist of an initial period, for which there is a one-time charge, followed by recurring period charges as agreed to by you. By choosing a recurring payment plan, you acknowledge that such Services have an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. We may submit periodic charges (e.g., monthly) without further authorization from you, until you provide prior notice (receipt of which is confirmed by us) that you have terminated this authorization or wish to change your payment method. Such notice will not affect charges submitted before we reasonably could act. To terminate your authorization or change your payment method, go to the account settings on FlicBuzz, Apple iTunes, or Google Play as applicable.</li>
							<li><strong>Current Information Required.</strong>You must provide current, complete and accurate information for your billing account. You must promptly update all information to keep your billing account current, complete and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card number or credit card expiration date), and you must promptly notify us or our payment processor if your payment method is cancelled (e.g., for loss or theft) or if you become aware of a potential breach of security, such as the unauthorized disclosure or use of your user name or password. Changes to such information can be made in your account settings. If you fail to provide any of the foregoing information, you agree that we may continue charging you for any use of paid services under your billing account unless you have terminated your paid services as set forth above.</li>
							<li><strong>Change in Amount Authorized.</strong>If the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of GST, state sales taxes), you have the right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction. Any agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your Payment Method. You agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.</li>
							<li><strong>Auto-Renewal for Paid Services.</strong>Unless you opt out of auto-renewal, which can be done through your account settings, any Paid Services you have signed up for will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription term originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional rate. To change or resign your Paid Services at any time, go to account settings. If you terminate a Paid Service, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current term and your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires. However, you won't be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period. If you do not want to continue to be charged on a recurring basis, you must cancel the applicable Paid Service through your account settings or terminate your Company account before the end of the recurring term. Paid Services cannot be terminated before the end of the period for which you have already paid, and except as expressly provided in these terms, FlicBuzz will not refund any fees that you have already paid.</li>
							<li><strong>Reaffirmation of Authorization.</strong> Your non-termination or continued use of a Paid Service reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your Payment Method for that Paid Service. We may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially selected to use the Paid Service.</li>
							<li><strong>Cancellation Policy</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>A subscriber cannot place any cancellation order for a particular service.</li>
									<li>Fee once paid will not be refunded in any case even if the cancellation request is send across.</li>
									<li>A service stands cancel if next payment is not received within 2 working days</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><strong>Refund Policy</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>Every service offered by us takes different course of action to get accomplished from start to end thus NO refund policy is there.</li>
									<li>No refund will be entertained in case service gets cancelled due to any violation of terms stated in our Terms & Condition section.</li>
									<li>TenCom Ventures is not liable to pay refund if delay or service disruption happens due to third party involvement</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><strong>Free Trials and Other Promotions.</strong>Any free trial or other promotion that provides access to a Paid Service must be used within the specified time of the trial. You must stop using a Paid Service before the end of the trial period in order to avoid being charged for that Paid Service. If you cancel prior to the end of the trial period and are inadvertently charged for a Paid Service, please contact us at <a class="e" data-e="support" data-sub="Terms of Service" href="mailto:support@Flicbuzz.com">support@Flicbuzz.com</a>.</li>

							<li><strong>Waiver of Jury Trial.</strong>You and FlicBuzz waive any constitutional and statuatory rights to go to court and have a trial in front of a judge or jury. You and FlicBuzz are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and FlicBuzz over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, you and FlicBuzz waive all rights to a jury trial, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.</li>
							<li><strong>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</strong>All claims and disputers within the scope of this arbitration agreement must be arbitrated or litigated on an individual basis and not on a class basis. Claims of more than one customer or user cannot be arbitrated or litigated jointly or consolidated with those of any other customer or user. If however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth below.</li>
							<li><strong>Opt-out.</strong>You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: Tencom Ventures Pvt Ltd 701, Akurthi Aneri, Behind Marol Maroshi Bus Depot, Marol, Andheri East, Mumbai- 400 059 (Attn: General Counsel) postmarked within 30 days of first accepting these Terms. You must include (1) your name and residence address; (2) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account; and (3) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Terms' arbitration agreement.</li>
							<li><strong>Exclusive Venue.</strong>7.If you send the opt-out notice, and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or FlicBuzz to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party and both you and FlicBuzz agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or courts located in Mumbai,India.</li>
